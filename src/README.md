##### How To Use
* If you are using IDE to run the app, you need to configure JUnit 5 on your IDE. 
* Run AppTest.java. This Unit Test class contains 3 test cases. First case, the actual result should be equal to expected result. Second case is using different parameter, the actual result should be equal to expected result also. Third case, actual result is not equal to expected result.

##### Decisions Made
* Created ArrayMultiplicationUtil.java to contain the logic in calculating the actual result from the given parameter. This way, it will be re-usable.
